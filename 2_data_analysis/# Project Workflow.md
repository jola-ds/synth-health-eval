# Project Workflow

This document records how the Synthetic Health Evaluation project evolved over time, including how work was organized, challenges faced, and decisions taken as the project progressed.

## 1. Project Origin & Context  

The project was initially started with a larger group, but participation was low and collaboration became difficult, especially because real data was not available at the time.  
Due to inactivity, the group dissolved. Few days later, some data was found, three members — **Jola, Martha, and Muqadsa** — decided to restart and complete the project.

A key constraint was time; what could have been a two-month work period was compressed into one month, meaning meetings and research had to be done quickly and often asynchronously.

## 2. Communication & Collaboration

- Slack was used for daily communication and discussions.
- Google Meet was used for meetings (5 meetings total, but spaced due to schedules).
- Collaboration happened mostly remotely and across different time zones.

**Why meetings were sparse:**  
Different availability, academic schedules, and timezone differences meant most progress was shared through Slack messages rather than long live calls.

## 3. Workflow Stages

| Stage | What happened |
|---|---|
| Setup | Repo created, Slack workspace formed |
| Planning | Literature search, defining project scope |
| Data Sourcing | Difficulty finding real data — slow progress |
| Restart | Core team resumed when seed data was obtained |
| Data Cleaning | Jola cleaned raw data into CSV |
| Research | Martha & Muqadsa reviewed synthetic data methods |
| Documentation | Meeting notes and workflow written |

## 4. Challenges & Decisions

### Challenges faced
- Difficulty obtaining real datasets
- Initial group inactivity
- Shortened timeline → faster execution required
- Timezone differences
- New research domain → steep learning curve

### Decisions made
- Reduce team to committed members only
- Continue with available seed data
- Use GitHub for version control and documentation
- Prioritize research + documentation while exploring generation methods

---

## 5. Current Status & Next Steps

**Completed:**
- Data obtained and cleaned
- Research on methodology
- Meetings documented
- Workflow documentation (this file)

**Still to be done:**
- Implement synthetic data generation
- Compare real vs synthetic data quality
- Write final evaluation & results report

## Reflection

This workflow is a record of the project’s evolution — how constraints shaped decisions, how the team reorganized, and how work continued despite challenges. It serves both as documentation for transparency and a reference for future contributors.
